F            C     G        Am       
Pearls And swine bereft of me

F        C         G        Am 
long and weary my road has been 

F           C Am 
i was lost in the cities 

G           C Am   
alone in the hills 

F         C Am     G         C Am   
no sorrow or pity for leaving i feel

[Chorus]

C           G              Dm   
I am not your rolling wheels 

Am 
I am the highway 

C          G               Dm 
I am not your carpet ride 

E            
I am the sky
